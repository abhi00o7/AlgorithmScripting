// A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.

// Create a function that sums two arguments together. If only one argument is provided, then return a function that expects one argument and returns the sum.

// For example, addTogether(2, 3) should return 5, and addTogether(2) should return a function.
